1. Change the color
Create an HTML file and a CSS file. Make the background color of the body red when the width of the viewport is smaller than 480px, green when the viewport width is bigger than (or equal to) 480px and smaller than 1024px, and blue when the viewport is bigger than (or equal to) 1024px.

ðŸ’¡ 480 and 1024 are also called breakpoints. They are typically used as threshold between cell phone, tablet, and computer.

2. Display / hide elements
Add three div: one div with the id="small", one div with the id="medium", another div with the id="large". In each element add the word small, medium and large respectively as content for display purposes.

Make it so only one div is displayed, according to the width of the current viewport.

3. Adapt the size of the text according to the device
In each div, add a title and a few paragraphs (lorem ipsum, and such). Give the title a descriptive text (for example: "Content for smartphones") Change the font size according to the device type.

4. Re-Arrange
Make it so that :

if small, the 3 divs are stacked on top of one and other.
if medium, the first div takes 2/3 of width, the second 1/3 of width and the third the full width.
if big, the 3 divs should be next to one another.
5. Continue
Make sure every future assignment is responsive!
Most CSS frameworks do this for you, but we will see them in the future :)
